# Hunter's Journal Vault (Obsidian)

This vault mixes a **useful guide (stats, tables, tactics)** with a **personal hunter's journal** — inspired by the Winchester journal vibe.

## Quick Start
1. Open this folder as a vault in Obsidian.
2. Install Community Plugins: **Dataview**, **Calendarium**.
3. Use the templates in `/Templates`:
   - Journal Entry Template
   - Session Template
   - Case File Template
   - Character/NPC/Lore Templates
4. Explore: 
   - `Campaigns/Blood on the Strand/Field Guide/` for the living guide.
   - `Campaigns/Blood on the Strand/Case Files/` for investigations.
   - `Campaigns/Blood on the Strand/Relationships.canvas` for connections.
   - `Campaigns/Blood on the Strand/Campaign Dataview Examples.md` for auto tables.

## Tips
- Create a daily journal (⌘P → Templates) and log signs, wounds, gear, and loose threads.
- Link entities with `[[...]]` to auto-surface in Dataview tables.
- Drag the Calendarium calendar pane to the side for a permanent in-vault calendar.
