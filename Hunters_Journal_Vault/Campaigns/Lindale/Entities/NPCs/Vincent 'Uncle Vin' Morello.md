# Vincent "Uncle Vin" Morello

Gatekeeper between the mortal underworld and the occult. Ran **The Chain**, a shadow brokerage balancing debts across supernatural factions. Pragmatic, disciplined, not a hero â€” a survivor who kept the peace by making deals and enforcing the terms.

## Hooks
- Vanished mid-drink; cigarette burned to the filter.
- Debts left unpaid; enemies and allies may test Garret.

## What he taught Garret
- Talk first, end cleanly when forced.
- Never leave loose ends.
- The city keeps its own score.
