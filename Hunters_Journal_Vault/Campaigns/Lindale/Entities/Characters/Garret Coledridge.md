# Garret Coledridge

## Biography
British-born. Fled England after a violent incident defending his sister. In New York, mentored by Vincent "Uncle Vin" Morello — a fixer who ran a network called **The Chain**, brokering mortal and supernatural debts. Garret acted as muscle and driver, sometimes for clients that were anything but human.

### The Forgotten Beneath
One night, sent to an abandoned subway platform to meet **The Preacher** — tall, old-fashioned, black eyes. Given a brass key to open a sealed maintenance door. Inside was a void that consumed a group of silent followers. The Preacher smiled and called it “a debt repaid.” Missing posters appeared across the city afterward; faces Garret recognized.

### Aftermath
Morello vanished without a trace. Garret keeps a notebook of names and faces of the missing, the people he failed — and the ones he damned.
