# The Chain

A supernatural clearinghouse operating under the guise of a discreet crime outfit. Tracks obligations across vampires, sorcerers, and stranger things. Its purpose: keep the balance and ensure that every debt is paid â€” without exposing the unnatural to the public.

## Operations
- Collections & Fixing (mortal facade)
- Enforcing the hidden "masquerade"
- Handling occult debts and disposals

## Current Status
- Leader missing (Morello). Network fragments remain.
- Unknown whether allegiance leans toward any single faction.
